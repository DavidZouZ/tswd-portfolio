# Assignment: Visualizing government debt using Tableau

## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

_Include your visualization, and introduce us to what you did._

Online Visualization: <https://data-viewer.oecd.org?chartId=ebdfc227-57ba-42ec-83e0-ad2243ad4d1d>

What I did: I selected the 2023 as the single year for governments debt-to-GDP ratio graph.

## Part 2: Working with Tableau

_A reminder that to get the Tableau visualization to render correctly on Github, you'll have to do a bit of editing of the code block once you paste it here.  As before, make sure to walk us through what you did in Tableau, and any thoughts or observations, etc._

<script type='text/javascript'>
var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1725567390614');                    
var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

## Part 3: Create your own visualization

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
