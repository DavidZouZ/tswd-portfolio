## Second-hand Cars Depreciation Rates in the U.S.

### 1.1. High-level Summary:

Purchasing a second-hand car is a significant decision that involves balancing cost, reliability, and long-term value. One crucial factor that often influences this decision is the depreciation rate of the vehicleâ€”a measure of how quickly a car loses its value over time. This project aims to provide readers, specifically potential second-hand car buyers, with detailed insights into the depreciation rates of various cars in the U.S. market. By analyzing factors such as region, car body styles, brand, and other dimensions, the project seeks to help buyers make informed decisions to maximize their investment.

Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, we will present rankings and trends that highlight which cars depreciate slower and the fundamental reasons behind these patterns. By understanding the underlying logic of depreciation, readers can gain a competitive edge in the market, ensuring they choose vehicles that offer the best value retention. This project not only delivers direct information but also fosters a deeper understanding of the automotive market dynamics affecting depreciation.
