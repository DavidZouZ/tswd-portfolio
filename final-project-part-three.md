# Changes made since Part II
>  Few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.

Since the completion of Part II, I focused on refining both the narrative and the technical aspects of the dashboards to enhance the clarity and user engagement of the story-telling. The first change was **the development of a clear thesis statement: “Don’t Merely Consider Sedan/SUV/Electric Vehicle When Buying a Used Car.”** This change was introduced to address a key piece of feedback that the narrative lacked purpose and persuasion. By introducing this thesis, I provided the entire data story with a central guiding idea, allowing the visualizations and supporting data to connect back to this main point. The thesis gave the presentation a stronger argumentative structure, making it easier for the audience to follow the story and engage with the key insights.

I also responded to concerns about the overwhelming amount of information presented in certain dashboards. During Part II, some dashboards attempted to convey too many data points in a single view, making it hard for users to focus on specific insights. To address this, I **separated the more complex dashboards into two or more focused visualizations**, which made the data easier to digest. For example, I split a crowded dashboard that combined top/least depreciation brands and body style into separate ones, each focusing on a single and more accessible dimension.

Another critical design change was the introduction of **interactivity in the dashboard**. Based on feedback from interviews, users expressed a desire for a more personalized experience. I implemented interactive elements on the last dashboards, such as clickable filters, allowing users to drill down into specific data points, like depreciation rates by brand, body style, or the year of cars. This change not only made the dashboards more engaging but also gave users the flexibility to explore data that was most relevant to their needs, which utilized the functionanities of Tableau.

What's more, I made **simplification on the color scheme**. Feedback indicated that the original dashboards had too many different colors, which made it difficult for users to focus on key points. I reworked the visuals to use a consistent color palette, primarily blue and orange, which helped to unify the design across all dashboards.

In addition to these structural and design changes, I also **revised the content flow of the data story**. I adjusted the order of dashboards to create a more logical narrative progression, leading the audience from a high-level introduction of the used car market to more detailed and specific insights about car depreciation, body styles, and brands. This reorganization ensures that the audience can follow the story naturally.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.
