# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish. 

## Wireframes - Tableau Dashboard

## Storyboards:

1. The 1st dashboard introduces the enormous **U.S. used car market size** and why we should consider used car in terms of **affordability**.
2. The 2nd dashboard is the Cars.com data source introduction and its data distribution using mainly bar charts to show credibility and authority of the following information.
3. The 3rd dashboard provides comparisions of the avarage depreciation rate for different car **body styles** and **fuel types** as a more general dimension.
4. The 4th dashboard shows the relationship between the **number of cars on the market** and the depreciation rates of different **body styles**.
5. The 5th dashboard goes deeper into the **brand** dimension of depreciation; while some data (brands) are too niche.
6. The 6th dashboard continue discuss the **top and least depreciation used car brands** which are more popular.


# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

The target audience for this series of dashboards would be potential used car buyers (e.g. college students, new grads), car related financial decision-makers, car enthusiast, and automotive industry professionals (e.g. dealers). 

The incorporation of various dimensions (body style, fuel type, brand) ensures that the dashboards address both general and niche audiences, focusing on popular vehicles while also acknowledging more niche brands.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Audience interest | What do you care about the most when you purchase a car (used car)? |
| Feedback on the storyline | What do you think of the current structure of the story? |
| Feedback on visualization | Any suggestions on the current visualizaitions? |

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (BIDA 20') | Interview 2 (MISM 20') | Interview 3 (MISM 20') |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What do you care about the most when you purchase a car (used car)? | Price | How much cheaper it is comparing to the MSRP | Appearance |
| What do you think of the current structure of the story? | Lack of purpose and persuation statement | Can be more specific | Good |
| Any suggestions on the current visualizaitions? | Too many different colors | Don't know where to focus on some dashboards, too crowded | Will be better if interactive |


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too much facts, but lack of persuation | Set up an thesis statement: Don't Merely Consider Sedan/SUV/Electric Vehicle When Buying Used Car (already done) |
| Be specific at the 6th dashboard | Set up an interactive dashboard that shows different dep. rates by body styples when clicking on different brand (already done) |
| Unity of color usage | Change the color set up by using mainly blue and orange (already done) |
| Too much info in one dashboard | Seperate the crowded dashboard into two dashboards (already done) |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here.

My final thoughts on the feedback and the anticipated changes are that these adjustments will enhance both the clarity and engagement of the presentation. By introducing a clear thesis statement and simplifying the visuals with unified color schemes and interactive elements, the revised dashboard will better communicate the key insights and keep the audience focused on the essential data.
