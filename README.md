# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! This is David (Zexin) Zou, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a minor in Business Studies, from New York University. I am writing to express my interest in the journey of data visualization and story telling with data.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience across various industries, including consulting, internet technology (advertisement), and finance. These experiences have honed my ability to tackle complex problems and enhanced my data processing and analytical skills. I am proficient in managing databases and extracting data using SQL, conducting mathematical modeling with MATLAB and Python (Scikit-learn), and creating data visualizations using Tableau and Python (matplotlib). My research experience at NYU further strengthened my ability to conduct independent research and introduced me to the application of NLP in big data. Additionally, my entrepreneurial endeavors have sharpened my business acumen and refined my communication and management skills.

# What I hope to learn
1. The most effcient and effective data visualization methodology that can be apply to different real world circumstances.
2. How to set up a Github portfolio is also new and interesting.
3. How to build live/online/auto-update data visualization dashboard.

## Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
