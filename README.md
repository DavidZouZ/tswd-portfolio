# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! This is David (Zexin) Zou, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a minor in Business Studies, from New York University. I am writing to express my interest in the journey of data visualization and story telling with data.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience across various industries, including consulting, internet technology (advertisement), and finance. These experiences have honed my ability to tackle complex problems and enhanced my data processing and analytical skills. I am proficient in managing databases and extracting data using SQL, conducting mathematical modeling with MATLAB and Python (Scikit-learn), and creating data visualizations using Tableau and Python (matplotlib). My research experience at NYU further strengthened my ability to conduct independent research and introduced me to the application of NLP in big data. Additionally, my entrepreneurial endeavors have sharpened my business acumen and refined my communication and management skills.

# What I hope to learn
1. The most effcient and effective data visualization methodology that can be apply to different real world circumstances.
2. How to set up a Github portfolio is also new and interesting.
3. How to build live/online/auto-update data visualization dashboard.
